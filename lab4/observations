Exercise 1

What went wrong?
	•	The program attempted to divide numerator (4) by denominator (0), causing a division by zero error.
Was it a problem with the program?
	•	Yes. Division by zero is undefined and should be handled to prevent runtime errors.
Or, was it a problem with data?
	•	It was a programming issue rather than a data problem.
From the stack trace, what exception was thrown?
	•	The stack trace shows an ArithmeticException with a message such as "java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero". This exception occurs specifically due to the division by zero.
Did it print “exercise_1(): end." statement?
	•	No, it did not print “exercise_1(): end.". The ArithmeticException caused the program to exit the method prematurely, so the statement after the division was not executed.

Exercise 2

When you are prompted to enter a number, enter an integer of your choice:
What is the output? 
	•	When you enter a valid integer (e.g., 5), the program calculates the square of the number and outputs. 
	OUTPUT:
	Enter an integer: 5
	The square of 5 is 25
	exercise_2(): end.
Did it print “exercise2(): end." statement?
	•	Yes.
	
When you are prompted to enter a number, enter the string, “oops”:
What is the output? 
	•	When you enter "oops", the program throws an InputMismatchException because it expects an integer input. 
	OUTPUT:
	Enter an integer: oops
	Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
